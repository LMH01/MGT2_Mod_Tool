# Welcome to the Mad Games Tycoon 2 Mod Tool

This is a little program that can modify some files of Mad Games Tycoon 2.

Before downloading please read [this information](docs/important.md) carefully.
## Download: [v4.4.0](https://github.com/LMH01/MGT2_Mod_Tool/releases/download/v4.4.0/MGT2_Mod_Tool_4.4.0.zip)
#### Getting started:
- Install Java 8 (if not already installed)
- Download and extract the `.zip` file
- Launch the tool by double-clicking one of the `.bat` files, located in the unzipped folder:
    - Use `start.bat` to launch the tool
    - Use `start_as_admin.bat` to launch the tool with admin rights. This is required when your MGT2 folder is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common`.
