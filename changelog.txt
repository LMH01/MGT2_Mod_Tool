This file contains the changelog of the tool (incomplete)

Important:
- Previously saved settings will not work together with this release
- Previously exported mods will not work together with this release
- Restore points that have been created prior to this release will not work together with this release

Coming in v2.3.0

New feature:

The tool now works under Linux
Mod export has been rewritten to use .toml files. This increases the speed at wich mods are exported.
Mod import has been rewritten from scratch. The result is a massive speed improvement, better reliability and more user-friendliness
Mods can now be exported in a bundle, this means that all mod data is stored in a single .toml file

Other:

Settings file now uses the .toml file format
Improved performance when handling files
Improved text area outputs when importing, exporting, adding or removing mods
Improved the error handling massively: Whenever something goes wrong the stacktrace is now written to the text area and an explanation of what went wrong is displayed
Internal code has been massively improved
Internal handling of paths and files has been improved: Renamed some folders to be more consistent
(Improved the way imports work: Importing things should no longer fail when a required mod is missing, instead a random one will be selected. This has already been implemented for some mods but this update adds this feature to all mods)
