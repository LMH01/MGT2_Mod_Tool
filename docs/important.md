## Important:
Please create a new initial backup always when the game has been updated to prevent issues!

To update the initial backup go to `Backup -> Create backup -> Create new initial backup` and follow the instructions

Because Mad Games Tycoon 2 is in early access, I can't promise that this version will be compatible with every update to come, but when an update makes this tool incompatible I will do my best to make it compatible again.

### Most new mods will only take effect once a new game is started!

### WARNING:

#### WHEN THE GAME IS UPDATED IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT YOUR MODIFICATIONS TO THE GAME FILES ARE LOST

#### TO COUNTERACT THIS YOU CAN CREATE A MOD RESTORE POINT IN THE BACKUP MENU
